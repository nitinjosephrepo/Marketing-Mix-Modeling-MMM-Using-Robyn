# Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) using Robyn

### What is Robyn?

### What is MMM?

Marketing Modeling Mix (MMM)  have been around for more than 60 years, but with dawn of digital marketing that relied on tags, cookies, pixels and mobiles IDs to craft well architected  bigger, better, more targeted campaigns they fell out of use. Until now. 

There are two main reason for their comeback 
1. A new wave of consumer privacy requirements and increased regulatory pressure have ushered in an enhanced focus on privacy and data protection. With these market changes, advertisers are becoming more concerned with platform-lock-in risks, the uncertainty surrounding matching algorithmsâ€™ accuracy without cookies and IDs, and the difficulty brands may have in collecting and building first-party data pools. Given this new environment, brands and marketers need to rethink their measurement strategies and audience-building methods
2. Inability to attribute the impact of offline channels (TV, Radio, Newspapers) to conversion or sales 

Thus Marketing mix modeling (MMM) is a privacy-friendly, highly resilient, data-driven statistical analysis that quantifies the incremental sales impact and ROI of marketing and non-marketing activities. MMM is an econometric model that aims to quantify the incremental impact of marketing and non-marketing activities on a pre-defined KPI (like sales or website visits). 

This is a holistic model used to understand how to allocate a marketing budget across marketing channels, products and regions and can help forecast the impact of future events or campaigns
